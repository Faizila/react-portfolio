# Description

* Portfolio page showcases the skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. It highlights the strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

* I have used React, HTML, advanced CSS and bootstrap properties to make a professional portfolio page.

* Portfolio page has the name on the top of the page, followed by a picture and icon links.

* User can click the icon buttons to checkout the profile on Linkedin, Github and can also view the PDF version of the resume.

* It has a navigation list on the left side of the page. Once clicked, it leads the user to the corresponding section on that page.

* About Me section tells the user about who I am as a person.

* Resume section gives the user a brief summary of technical skills and projects. It also has a PDF icon that user can click to view and download the PDF version of the resume.

* Portfolio section lets the user visit the deployed applications. Once user will hover over the image, two links will be visible to the user and will take the user to the corresponding Git Repo/Webpage.

* Contact Me section has an email and a phone number listed on left side of the page followed by a contact form on the right side of the page. User can also fill out the form to reachout via portfolio page.
